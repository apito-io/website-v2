Although headless content management systems are becoming more popular, 
you might be unsure if they are right for your upcoming project. I listed the benefits 
of the new strategy above conventional server-side CMS. Thus, you will be able to decide 
for yourself if Headless CMS will help your project succeed or not.

# What is a Headless CMS?

Simply said, it is a separate admin panel that is just responsible for managing and storing content. 
It offers front-end (the presentational portion of the website) access to the material through API. 
By doing this, we assign the Front-end framework and CMS different roles in terms of delivering and 
storing material. Everything will carry out its finest function.


It is comparable, for instance, to a Wordpress admin panel without a direct link to the website. 
There, you solely keep track of your posts and page information. While the front end is distinct 
and uses the CMS's data exclusively through its API,

# Better Performance

What benefits would a greater performance have for you first? More than 53% of consumers would 
abandon a website if it takes longer than three seconds to load, according to [Google's research](https://www.thinkwithgoogle.com/marketing-resources/data-measurement/mobile-page-speed-new-industry-benchmarks/). 
Imagine that if your mobile site is sluggish, over half of your readers will stop visiting. 
And according to additional Google data, the majority of websites take more than 3 seconds to load. 
In order to differentiate yourself from the competition, go fast.

The study was illuminating. The visual material above the fold took longer than 5 seconds to load on 70% of the mobile landing pages we examined, and it took longer than 7 seconds for all visual content above and below the fold to fully load.

The installation of the front-end is completely under your control, 
which results in the high performance of websites powered by Headless CMS. 
Headless CMS is not overloaded with additional presentational logic code at the same time. 
Therefore, coders just use what is required and omit the extra. The majority of optimizations 
are also handled by contemporary front-end frameworks.

# Lower time to Market, Faster Development

Your chances of success increase the quicker you test your ideas and bring them to market.

Since you don't have to spend time on finding workarounds and addressing issues in order to incorporate a not trivial feature, 
developing websites using Headless CMS is often faster. Without being constrained by the CMS, 
you create the front-end in your own style.

Front-end With the use of frameworks, high-quality websites may be created quickly. The support, 
editing, and scaling of websites created using frameworks is simpler.

# Highly Customizable & Flexible Front-end

You have control over how users interact with your site thanks to the flexibility of the front-end 
solution. You may now build features that server-side CMS just couldn't support. Your website's 
UX may be customized to support your objectives, whether they be more readers, subscribers, or 
customers.

Due to the division of labor between your front-end display and headless CMS, websites are able to 
be more flexible. Because of the numerous limitations of traditional CMS, developers must frequently 
discover workarounds to add functionalities.

# Cross-platform content Delivery

REST API is used by Headless CMS to give data. Thus, it is not dependent on a certain tech stack. 
Using the same technology, you may even include material into an application that has already 
been created.

Regardless of the program you use—web, desktop, or mobile—you can access your material. 
This can help you save time and money.

# Conclusion

Undoubtedly, there are many benefits to adopting a novel approach to website development and content 
delivery. But that does not imply that it is always the best option. With this knowledge, 
I hope you can make an informed decision and select the finest technological solution for your 
objective.

Just to be clear, I prefer utilizing headless content management systems and front-end React 
frameworks like Next.js or Gatsby to construct my websites and the websites for my clients.

Enjoy your day and create awesome websites!
