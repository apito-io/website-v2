        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Apito is a Cloud based Service that helps you build API easily. You can think of it as a firebase alternative.
This guide will show you how you can use Apito to build API for your next project or application.</p><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://cdn.apito.io/media/apito_documentation/2K07YCORYV_Apito_Console.png" alt="Apito Console" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>If you havent already created an account in apito please go to <a href="https://app.apito.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this link</a> and create one.
Once you logged in to <code>Apito Console</code> you will a Project Space like above. You can use this space to switch between
your projects or create a new one.</p><p>Now, for this quick started guide I will be creating an API for an ecommerce project, so lets gets started.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="1-create-your-project">1. Create your project<a class="hash-link" href="#1-create-your-project" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>Click on the Start a new Project button to initialize your project creation. Enter your project name and description
and click Continue. On the next page select Apito Cloud option to create your project faster. Other Database
options will soon be available. Congratulation! you project is being build. Once it’s done you can click
Explore new project to switch to your newly created project and start building your API instantly.</p><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://cdn.apito.io/media/apito_documentation/NW09WSY56N_Create_Project.png" alt="Apito Create a Project" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>The first step after creating your project is to define your project models. The most important part of designing an
API is Database Modeling. Let’s start by creating our first model. We all know Products and categories are a crucial part of an ecommerce API.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="2-model-your-database-with-models--fields">2. Model your Database with models &amp; fields<a class="hash-link" href="#2-model-your-database-with-models--fields" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>Click on the Models Tab in the top navigation menu. Then from the left side bar, click on Add a model button.
Now, write down the name of the model, in our case it will be product. Now click on the create button.</p><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://cdn.apito.io/media/apito_documentation/OUHYWT8VH4_Create_Model.png" alt="Database Model Creation" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>Next, we will add few fields to our newly created product model.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="fields">Fields<a class="hash-link" href="#fields" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>To add fields to a model click on the Add a Field button. First, we will add a title field of
type text and we will set the attribute of the title to required. Then, a description field of type, Rich Text.
An Image field of type, Media. A Price field of type, Number. And last but not least a Rating field of type, Number.
Now let’s create another model named Category and add few fields in it. Those fields will be name, label and icons.
Apito model &amp; field builder is very versatile you can use it to design complex and nested model structure.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="relations">Relations<a class="hash-link" href="#relations" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>Next, we will create relations between them. For that you need to click on the
Add Field Button and then select Relations. Your relation creation between models depends on your project requirements.</p><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://cdn.apito.io/media/apito_documentation/G7NHVB7U6I_Add_Fields.png" alt="Database Relations" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>For now, let’s say, Product has many categories and categories has many products. Wow, as you can see, how easy it is to create entity relations between models in apito.
Also, you can rename, delete and create fields &amp; relations anytime you want. Now, that our database design of product and category model with relation is created,
we are ready to insert some contents.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="3-insert-your-content">3. Insert your content<a class="hash-link" href="#3-insert-your-content" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>Click on the Contents tab and select your model. As you can see, Table and forms are auto generated based on your database model design.
Let me insert few products and categories into our database. To add a new product, click on the Add a new product button, which is on the right side of the product content table.
You will be able to see a drawer pops up from the right side of our table, which contains an auto generated specialized input form based on your model design.</p><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://cdn.apito.io/media/apito_documentation/JB6YZSJ7ZE_Add_A_Content.png" alt="Content Management" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>Let’s add our first product using this form into our database. Let’s add our first category into our database.
As you can see while creating a category you can directly tag products with it. As you can see that product and category are now linked with each other.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="4-explore-both-graphql--rest-api">4. Explore Both GraphQL &amp; REST API<a class="hash-link" href="#4-explore-both-graphql--rest-api" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>Our Ecommerce API is ready. To explore our API lets goto the <code>API Explorer</code> from the top of the navigation menu. As you can see, our GraphQL &amp; REST API is ready for use.
Let’s run our first query. We will now <code>Search a product that contains blue in its name</code>. Now click Run and as you can see its working! our ecommerce API is ready for integration.</p><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://cdn.apito.io/media/apito_documentation/0X6Z0YYA1V_GraphQL_Explorer.png" alt="GraphQL Explorer" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>You can also use REST API if you project requires it. Apito Generates a Swagger Documentation which is compatible with OpenAPI.</p><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://cdn.apito.io/media/apito_documentation/09SNMJMSIX_RESTful_API_Explorer.png" alt="Swagger UI" class="img_ev3q"></p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Internet is filled with tons of articles and tutorials that talk about building production-ready and scalable apps
for both web and mobile. Developers often time get caught up trying to apply the same principle or guide but often time
they ended up "re-inventing the wheel" Apito and Firebase both come with Backend as a Service (BaaS) APIs that help
you develop your application faster. A key component of any BaaS is instant APIs over a database </p><ul><li>once you define your database schema, you should get data APIs instantly.</li></ul><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="comparing-apples-to-applesauce">Comparing Apples to Applesauce<a class="hash-link" href="#comparing-apples-to-applesauce" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>Apito and Firebase both offer APIs over a database while both of them provide this solution on top of a proprietary
database. We use nn optimized version of RocksDB. Soon Apito will be able to connect to several popular choices of
databases including PostgreSQL, MySQL, Mariadb, Mongodb &amp; ArangoDB. That is a topic of another discussion.</p><p>Firebase was originally designed exclusively as a realtime database. If your project does not need a real-time database
then using it is exteamly difficult for modern application development. </p><p>Let me tell you why, </p><p>Querying &amp; Filtering your data is very difficult with Firebase, wherewith Apito you can execute bulk queries with complex
filters ( even geospatial queries ) Also, Once an application is in production, you will need to write complex queries,
especially for the purpose of Analytics or Business Intelligence. With Firebase, you are restricted to basic CRUD queries.
This is okay for rapid prototyping but does not lend itself to a production app.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="database-design-migration--content-management">Database Design, Migration &amp; Content Management<a class="hash-link" href="#database-design-migration--content-management" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>This is probably one of the biggest gripes power users have with Firebase. On Firebase, you can only change data from
the client-side. This means you have to write a script to perform a schema evolution (which is error-prone and
risky if not performed in a transaction, or in sets of transactions) or handle the schema evolution in the app code
itself! </p><p>But on the other hand, On Apito, Migration happens instantly once you modify your model and publish it. This is similar
to the natural developer workflow of taking changes in dev and then applying them in staging/production environments.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="data-modeling">Data modeling<a class="hash-link" href="#data-modeling" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>Thanks to Apito's Versatile Model Builder, it supports various fields to model and structures your project,
for example, Single Line Text Field, Date Field, Number Field, Fields within Fields ( Array of Object) and
the Most important feature is the relation between models ( One-to-One, One-to-Many, Many-to-Many )
It is harder to model relationships between independent data models with Firebase's proprietary database
(originally a realtime database). If you made a mistake early on in your modelling, migrating and changing
to a new data model is hard.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="role-based-permissions">Role based Permissions<a class="hash-link" href="#role-based-permissions" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>Firebase permissions can only capture rules based on the data within the current 'path' (node). </p><p>On Apito, you can specify granular permissions based on roles. That can be attatched to any API endpoints &amp; models.
<a href="/docs/console/adding-rbac-role-based-permissions-support-to-your-api">Read more here.</a></p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="a-back-end-for-saas-apps">A Back-end for SaaS Apps<a class="hash-link" href="#a-back-end-for-saas-apps" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>Firebase is a well-known backend-as-a-service. It has a ton of useful features that can all be tuned and tweaked to power
the back-end of a SaaS application. That said, they've made a much larger effort to be the cloud back-end for mobile apps.
As a developer building SaaS, you can configure Firebase services to suit your requirements, but it's always going to
be extra work. With Apito, that's pretty different. 8base designed its platform to best accommodate SaaS apps from day
one; with a GraphQL API for any web-client, or mobile, to consume. This naturally makes it ideal for developers
looking for a backend-as-a-service on any SaaS project. Why? Because things like authorization, multi-tenancy,
user administration, and a relational schema builder are all native to the platform.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="to-summarize-our-points-apito-has-many-advantages-including">To summarize our points, Apito has many advantages including<a class="hash-link" href="#to-summarize-our-points-apito-has-many-advantages-including" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><ul><li>Easy Learning Curve</li><li>Versatile Database Modeling</li><li>Robust Content Management System</li><li>Complex Query &amp; Filtering</li><li>Role based Permissions</li><li>Build In Support for Multilingual Content</li><li>Instant GraphQL &amp; REST API Endpoints</li><li>Webhooks</li><li>Authentication Module</li><li>Cloud Functions</li></ul><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://cdn.apito.io/media/apito_documentation/XJUZG5CEW9_Apito_Vs_Firebase.png" alt="Apito vs Firebase Comparison" class="img_ev3q"></p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="graphql-or-restful-api-why-not-both">GraphQL or RESTful API? Why not Both?<a class="hash-link" href="#graphql-or-restful-api-why-not-both" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>Today, almost all apps are data-driven. Making sure a developer has access to the data they need when they need it, and
as they need it, is super important. For the past decade, REST has been the API standard. While the world has benefited
hugely from REST, it has some limitations. GraphQL, on the other hand, comes with some huge advantages when compared
to REST. A single endpoint can support any query or mutation (a.k.a. update). </p><p>Queries get defined on the client-side, meaning no more endpoint updates done by backend developers.
Queries only return data that the developer wants.
Out of the box, Firebase lets users build REST endpoints. You can set up a GraphQL engine on Firebase, but it takes a lot of time and a lot of know-how.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="role-based-security">Role-Based Security<a class="hash-link" href="#role-based-security" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>Meanwhile, as everyone is out there building the sleekest, and most straightforward user interface that enchants
the pants off users, app security is too often being overlooked. That's why Firebase and Apito have security built
directly into their products. Firebase offers the ability to set up role-based security using custom functions that
get stored as rules. Every rule is then validated against each API requests. </p><p>The developer can define all their custom authentication logic. Apito built role-based security directly into its
platform, and expose that to developers through a configurable interface. It makes adding permissions and roles for
specific actions on specific tables and fields super straight forward. It also supports role-based scoping of records
using custom filters. Pretty much, if developers follow either platform's documentation around how to set up
authorization, they won't have to worry about security. It's just up to them how long they want to take to get there.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="conclusion">Conclusion<a class="hash-link" href="#conclusion" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>There are millions of developers in the world, each with their nuanced preferences to specific stacks and tools.
In the greater software ecosystem, 1000s of tools and services exist to help support developers in building amazing
apps. Of all the tools, services, frameworks, platforms, and specifications, only a few stand out. </p><p>Apito gives developers a back-end they need when building modern apps, the way that they would have wanted to build it themselves.
By configuring dozens of clutch back-end resources and offering them as a production-ready platform, you can easily write
your project-specific business logic with cloud function Knowing the whole time that security, scalability, database management,
and the like are future proof.</p><p>A developer is going to come across both Apito and Firebase when researching backend-as-a-service platforms. Both
platforms are going to offer them similar features that are backed by different implementations. That said, the experience
that the developer has when using either platform is the real acid test.</p>]]></content>
