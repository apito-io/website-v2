Node.js has become a popular choice for developing content management systems (CMS) due to its scalability, flexibility, and ease of use. There are several Node.js CMS options available, each with its own unique features and advantages. In this article, we'll compare Gatsby, Next.js, Angular, Apito CMS, and GraphQL APIs and help you choose the right one for your project.

## Gatsby CMS

Gatsby is a static site generator that uses React.js and GraphQL to build static websites. It offers several advantages, including fast page load times, SEO optimization, and a large plugin ecosystem. Gatsby also offers a headless CMS solution called Gatsby Cloud that allows users to manage their content without the need for a separate CMS.

## Next.js CMS

Next.js is a popular server-side rendering framework for React.js. It offers several advantages, including easy setup, automatic code splitting, and hot module replacement. Next.js also has a built-in API route that allows developers to create RESTful or GraphQL APIs.

## Angular CMS

Angular is a popular front-end framework that can be used to develop CMSs. It offers several advantages, including powerful data binding, modular architecture, and a large community. Angular also offers a built-in testing framework and CLI for easier development.

## Apito CMS

Apito CMS is an API-first, headless CMS solution that offers several advantages, including a user-friendly interface, flexible content modeling, and robust APIs for integrating with other platforms. Apito CMS offers a variety of data types, including text, image, video, and audio, and supports multiple languages and locales.

## GraphQL APIs

GraphQL is a query language and runtime for APIs that was developed by Facebook. It offers several advantages over REST APIs, including the ability to request only the data you need, a strong type system, and real-time updates. GraphQL can be used with any front-end framework or language, and is often used with Node.js.

To connect to a GraphQL API in Node.js, we can use the Apollo Client library. Here is an example of how to connect to a GraphQL API using Apollo Client:

```javascript
const { ApolloClient, InMemoryCache, gql } = require('@apollo/client');

const client = new ApolloClient({
  uri: 'https://api.example.com/graphql',
  cache: new InMemoryCache()
});

client.query({
  query: gql`
    query GetUsers {
      users {
        id
        name
        email
      }
    }
  `
})
  .then(data => console.log(data))
  .catch(error => console.error(error));
```
In this example, we create a new ApolloClient instance with the URI of our GraphQL API and an InMemoryCache. We then use the query function to retrieve data from the API. The query is defined using GraphQL syntax and specifies the data we want to retrieve.

# Choosing the Right Node.js CMS

In conclusion, Node.js and JavaScript-based CMSs such as Gatsby, Next.js, and Angular provide developers with powerful tools for building dynamic, high-performing websites and web applications. And with the growing popularity of headless CMS architecture, CMS APIs have become a critical component in delivering content and digital assets to end-users. While connecting to GraphQL APIs in Node.js can be accomplished with popular libraries like Apollo Client, using a service like Apito CMS is the best option for generating and managing CMS APIs. Apito CMS simplifies the process of creating, updating, and managing APIs, allowing developers to focus on building great user experiences and delivering content to their audiences with speed and efficiency. 

With Apito CMS, developers can easily customize their CMS APIs to meet the specific needs of their applications, and enjoy the benefits of a scalable and secure infrastructure that can handle any level of traffic.
