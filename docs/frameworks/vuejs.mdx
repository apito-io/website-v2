According to the offical doc Vue (pronounced /vjuː/, like view) is a progressive framework for building user interfaces.

Unlike other monolithic frameworks, Vue is designed from the ground up to be incrementally adoptable. The core library is focused on the view layer only,
and is easy to pick up and integrate with other libraries or existing projects. On the other hand, Vue is also perfectly capable of powering sophisticated
Single-Page Applications when used in combination with modern tooling and supporting libraries.

This doc is transformed from the vuejs official installation page [here](https://apollo.vuejs.org/guide/installation.html#installation)

In your vue-cli 3 project:

```shell
vue add apollo
```

# Manual installation

## 1. Apollo Client

You can either use Apollo Boost or Apollo Client directly (more configuration work).

### Apollo Boost

Apollo Boost is a zero-config way to start using Apollo Client. It includes some sensible defaults, such as our recommended InMemoryCache and HttpLink,
which come configured for you with our recommended settings and it's perfect for starting to develop fast.

Install it alongside vue-apollo and graphql:
```
npm install --save vue-apollo graphql apollo-boost
```
Or:
```
yarn add vue-apollo graphql apollo-boost
```
In your app, create an ApolloClient instance:

```javascript
import ApolloClient from 'apollo-boost'

const apolloClient = new ApolloClient({
    // You should use an absolute URL here
    uri: 'https://api.apito.io/secured/graphql',
    headers: {
        Authorization: `Bearer API_SECRET`,
    },
})
```
#### Apollo client full configuration

If you want some more fine grained control install these packages instead of apollo-boost:

npm install --save vue-apollo graphql apollo-client apollo-link apollo-link-http apollo-cache-inmemory graphql-tag
Or:

yarn add vue-apollo graphql apollo-client apollo-link apollo-link-http apollo-cache-inmemory graphql-tag
In your app, create an ApolloClient instance:

```javascript
import { ApolloClient } from 'apollo-client'
import { createHttpLink } from 'apollo-link-http'
import { InMemoryCache } from 'apollo-cache-inmemory'

// HTTP connection to the API
const httpLink = createHttpLink({
  // You should use an absolute URL here
  uri: 'http://localhost:3020/graphql',
})

// Cache implementation
const cache = new InMemoryCache()

// Create the apollo client
const apolloClient = new ApolloClient({
  link: httpLink,
  cache,
})
```

## 2. Install the plugin into Vue

```javascript
import Vue from 'vue'
import VueApollo from 'vue-apollo'

Vue.use(VueApollo)
```


## 3. Apollo provider

The provider holds the Apollo client instances that can then be used by all the child components.

```javascript
const apolloProvider = new VueApollo({
    defaultClient: apolloClient,
})
```
Add it to your app with the apolloProvider option:

```javascript
new Vue({
  el: '#app',
  // inject apolloProvider here like vue-router or vuex
  apolloProvider,
  render: h => h(App),
})
```
You are now ready to use Apollo in your components!

# IDE integration

## Visual Studio Code
If you are using VS Code, it's recommended to install the Apollo GraphQL extension (opens new window).

Then configure it by creating a apollo.config.js file in the root folder of the Vue project:

```javascript title='apollo.config.js'
module.exports = {
  client: {
    service: {
      name: 'my-app',
      // URL to the GraphQL API
      url: 'http://localhost:3000/graphql',
    },
    // Files processed by the extension
    includes: [
      'src/**/*.vue',
      'src/**/*.js',
    ],
  },
}
```

## Webstorm
If you are using Webstorm, it's recommended to install the JS GraphQL extension (opens new window).

Then configure it by creating a .graphqlconfig file in the root folder of the Vue project:

```json
{
  "name": "Untitled GraphQL Schema",
  "schemaPath": "./path/to/schema.graphql",
  "extensions": {
    "endpoints": {
      "Default GraphQL Endpoint": {
        "url": "http://url/to/the/graphql/api",
        "headers": {
          "user-agent": "JS GraphQL"
        },
        "introspect": false
      }
    }
  }
}
```
