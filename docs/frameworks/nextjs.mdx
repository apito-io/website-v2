Building websites with any CMS, API, or database is once again enjoyable thanks to NextJS, a quick and adaptable framework.

## Apito : The best Headless CMS for NextJS
Apito is a powerful headless cms to maintain and manage your static sites. it can deliver your content with GraphQL.

To make sure your site loads quickly, Gatsby automates a variety of tasks, including code splitting, image optimization, inlining crucial styles, lazy loading, and resource prefetching.


## Create a Next.js Project

To create a new Next.js application, we’ll use create-next-app:

```shell
npx create-next-app next-with-apollo
```

:::note

You can change next-with-apollo to be any project name, have fun with it, or choose the name of that project you want to build.

:::

With the app scaffolded and dependencies installed, we can now run the application:

```
cd next-with-apollo
npm run dev
```

## Setting Up Apollo Client

```
npm install @apollo/client graphql
```

With our dependencies in place, it’s now time to set up the client in our application.
Create a new file in the root of the project called apollo-client.js and add the following contents to it:

```javascript title=./apollo-client.js

import { ApolloClient, InMemoryCache } from "@apollo/client";

const client = new ApolloClient({
    uri: "https://api.apito.io/secured/graphql",
    cache: new InMemoryCache(),
    headers: {
        Authorization: `Bearer API_SECRET`,
    },
});

export default client;
```

Now we have a GraphQL client we can use within the application, and we’re ready to query for some data. However, before we can query for anything,
we first need to know what data is available to us from the Countries API.

# Using Apollo Client for statically rendered page data

Before we can fetch data from the API, we have to set up our page. We do this for statically generated pages using the `getStaticProps` method.
Next.js will use this function during the build process to get any data needed to be passed into the page component as props.

Because we’re using the methods provided by Next.js to fetch the data, we’re not going to be calling our API from within React itself.
So we’ll use Apollo Client directly instead of using hooks.

Inside of `pages/index.js` import the client we created in `apollo-client.js` and `gql from @apollo/client`.

```javascript title=pages/index.js

import { gql } from "@apollo/client";
import client from "../apollo-client";


export async function getStaticProps() {
    const { data } = await client.query({
      query: gql`
        query Books {
          name
          avatar
          authors {
            name
            address
          }
        }
      `,
    });

    return {
      props: {
        books: data.books.slice(0, 4),
      },
   };
}
```
