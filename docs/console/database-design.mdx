Database modeling is the most crucial part of your project. Model is the base of what your api will look like.
A model represents an entity of your business logic. For example if you are making an e-commerce website your model name could be, `Product`, `User`, `Order`, `Report`, `Shop` etc.


## Creating a Model Entity

In order to create model **Model** first click on the `Models` from the top navigation bar and click on the button on left side called `CREATE A MODEL`.
You will see a page like below. Enter your model name and click `CREATE MODEL`. You will see a success message afterwards

## Creating Fields Inside Models

Click on the model from the left side menu in-order to add fields to a model. You will see a button appear in the body of the page called `ADD A FIELD / RELATION`. Click on that button
to add fields to your model. Choose your relevant field type ( `Text`, `Number`, `Date`, `Dynamic List` etc) and fill up the necessary fields and click create.

## Creating Relations Between Models

In order to add relations between models click on the `ADD A FIELD` button or choose `Relation` from the left side of the side panel. You will see options like the picture below.

In order to a relationship betweend models you have to configure `Forward` and `Backward` relationship. For example, If you are creating a relations between a products and category,
Forward Relationship for that particular case could be **Products Has Many Categories** and Backward Relationship could be **Categories Has Many Products** This is also known as Many-to-Many Relationship

Known As (Optional) field is there if you ever need to overwrite a relationship name in the api. For example if you have two relationship with the same model, lets say,
For a project management application a project model could have multiple relationship with user model. One could be an assignee and other could be a reporter.
You can use this field to assign different name to your relation. Or else you cant have two different relationship with the same model.
