Apito Engine Generates both GraphQL & RESTful API Endpoints ( Swagger ) based on your models, and you can easily test both of them
by going to `API Explorer` tab in Apito Console

## GraphiQL Explorer

The first one is the GraphQL schema explorer called GraphiQL. Apito Console allows you to explore your generated GraphQL Server prior to usage.
You can explore all the `Queries` and `Mutations` on the left side of the Explorer.

## Swagger UI

The second one is the auto generated RESTful API ( Swagger )

### Trying Out the RESTApi Online

If you want to test your apito swagger api online or via curl first you have to generate an `Api Secret`. Click [here](/docs/console/api-integration-with-your-application) if you want to know how.
If you already have your api secrets generated then go to **API > RESTApi** and click on the green `authorize` button on the top right side.

Popup like similar below
will show, and you have to put your `Api Secret` in the format of `Bearer token` and click the green `Authorize` button.

Now click on any rest api from the list and click the `Try it out` button on the right side of the body of the api. You will be able to see a Blue `Execute` button
at the end of Parameters body. Click `Execute` button to try out the api. If your api has content then it will show in the response box, right below.
