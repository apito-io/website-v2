Choosing Between Single Page Record & Multi Page Record While Building your API could be a tricky and confusing term.
But let's make these terms clear and easy.

A Model represents a Single Entity of your project. If you already know SQL then you can compare it to columns.
The mail difference between a Single Record vs Multiple is weather it could hold a single record or multiples.

For example if you are starting an e-commerce project the common models are mostly **Products**, **Orders**, **Stores**, **Users**, **Carts**, **Reports** etc.
If you are designing a library management application the models are most likely to be **Books**, **Authors**, **Profile**, **Booking** etc.

But you are building api for a website or a landing page then it's better that you check `Single Record` checkbox while creating a model.
