You can use Auth Extension if your application has a login & signup feature, and your data is protected and only accessible after login.

Authentication is also a crucial part of any API or Backend. In order to add authentication support to our API first we have to create a role for which all authenticated users will belong to.
Go to Roles section where we covered this in details. You can not enable Auth without a Role. Let's assume a role named `AuthUser` is created.

## Enable Auth Extension

For this, Got to **Settings > Add-Ons** then Click on the `Authentication` module. You will see this drawer pops up from the right. You can configure your authentication module here.
Choose an Authentication Type and What role the logged-in user will belong to. Click Enable to add authentication support to your API.
To check if authentication module added to your API or not, Go to Content tab and if you can see a model named `user` then authentication support has successfully added to your API.

## Supported Authentication Type

At this moment we only support `phone` and `email` based authentication.

## Authentication Roles

Roles are very important part of the authentication module. The entire auth module depends on `Roles`. All the authenticated users will have the permissions of that role
that you configure while you add the authentication module.
