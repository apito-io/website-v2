Login token is equivalent to `API_SECRET` in Apito. Those token could be used alternatively with each other.
The main difference between those thow is how they are generated and what roles are they assigned to. Both `API_SECRET` and Login token operates on a `Role`.

Whenever a Login Token is generated either via Login or Register it operates on a Role (The role that is given during Authentication AddOn Configuration).
So generally speaking all the logged-in user will have access to that permissions given to that role.

Let's say if these are the permissions that are assigned to role `authuser`

### API Permission
Model | Read | Create | Update | Delete
:-- | :-- | :-- | :-- | :--: |
Product | All | None | None | None |
Category | All | None | None | None |
Order | Personal data | Personal data | None | None |
Store | All | None | None | None |
... | ... | ... | ... | ... |

As we can see user can read Product, Category, Store and only Their Personal Order. They are also allowed to create their own order but they cant update or delete anything.
So an authenticated login token has this permission embedded into them and api will work accordingly.

Lets say if you use Login token to call Order Delete then you will get an error.

## Calling an API using Login Token

Let's say after the user is logged in, You want to show the logged-in users their personal Orders.

```bash
curl -X GET "https://api.apito.io/secured/rest/project-id/orders"
-H  "accept: application/json"
-H  "Authorization: Bearer LOGIN_TOKEN"
-H  "Content-Type: application/json"
```
