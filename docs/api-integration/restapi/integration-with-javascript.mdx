## Using `Axios`

Axios: Axios is a Javascript library used to make HTTP requests from node. js or XMLHttpRequests from the browser,
and it supports the Promise API that is native to JS ES6. It can be used intercept HTTP requests and responses and
enables client-side protection against XSRF. It also has the ability to cancel requests.

```javascript
const token = 'apito-api-secret';
axios.get('https://api.apito.com/secured/rest/project', {
  headers: {
    'Authorization': `Bearer ${token}`
  }
})
.then((res) => {
  console.log(res.data)
})
.catch((error) => {
  console.error(error)
})
```

## Using `Fetch`

The Fetch API provides a JavaScript interface for accessing and manipulating parts of the HTTP pipeline, such as requests and responses.
It also provides a global fetch() method that provides an easy, logical way to fetch resources asynchronously across the network.

```javascript
const token = 'apito-api-secret';
fetch('https://api.apito.com/secured/rest/project', {
  headers: {
    Authorization: `Bearer ${token}`
  }
}).then(res => res.json())
  .then(json => console.log(json));
```
