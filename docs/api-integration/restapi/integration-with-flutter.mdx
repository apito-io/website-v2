import ApiSecretNote from "./shared/api-secret-note.mdx"

Dart has a composable, Future-based library for making HTTP requests. You can simply use this to connect with apito's rest api endpoints.
Here is an example below

## Using Dart's standard `http` library

<ApiSecretNote />

```dart
    String token = '<API_SECRET>';
    final response = await http.get(url, headers: {
      'Content-Type': 'application/json',
      'Accept': 'application/json',
      'Authorization': 'Bearer $token',
    });
    print(response);
```
