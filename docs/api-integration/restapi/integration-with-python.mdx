Python HTTP module defines the classes which provide the client-side of the HTTP and HTTPS protocols.
In most of the programs, the HTTP module is not directly used and is clubbed with the `urllib` module to handle URL connections and interaction with HTTP requests.
Today we will learn how to use a Python HTTP client to fire HTTP request and then parse response status and get response body data.

<ApiSecretNote />

```python
import http.client

conn = http.client.HTTPSConnection("https://api.apito.io/secured/rest/project")

headers = {
    'content-type': "application/json",
    'authorization': "Bearer API_SECRET"
    }

conn.request("GET", "/api", headers=headers)

res = conn.getresponse()
data = res.read()

print(data.decode("utf-8"))
```
