Perhaps one of the most important packages for any budding Go web developer is the `net/http` package.
This package allows you to build HTTP servers in Go with its powerful compositional constructs.
You can also use it to make remote http calls. Follow the example below

## Using `net/http` library

<ApiSecretNote />

```
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"net/http"
	"io/ioutil"
)

func main() {

	url := "https://api.apito.com/secured/rest/project-id"

	req, _ := http.NewRequest("GET", url, nil)

	req.Header.Add("content-type", "application/json")
	req.Header.Add("authorization", "Bearer API_SECRET")

	res, _ := http.DefaultClient.Do(req)

	defer res.Body.Close()
	body, _ := ioutil.ReadAll(res.Body)

	fmt.Println(res)
	fmt.Println(string(body))

}
```
