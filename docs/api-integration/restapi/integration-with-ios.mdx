The Foundation framework provides a base layer of functionality for apps and frameworks, including data storage and persistence, text processing,
date and time calculations, sorting and filtering, and networking. The classes, protocols, and data types defined by Foundation are used throughout
the macOS, iOS, watchOS, and tvOS SDKs.

<ApiSecretNote />

```swift
import Foundation

let headers = [
  "content-type": "application/json",
  "authorization": "Bearer API_SECRET"
]

let request = NSMutableURLRequest(url: NSURL(string: "https://api.apito.io/secured/rest/project-id")! as URL,
                                        cachePolicy: .useProtocolCachePolicy,
                                    timeoutInterval: 10.0)
request.httpMethod = "GET"
request.allHTTPHeaderFields = headers

let session = URLSession.shared
let dataTask = session.dataTask(with: request as URLRequest, completionHandler: { (data, response, error) -> Void in
  if (error != nil) {
    print(error)
  } else {
    let httpResponse = response as? HTTPURLResponse
    print(httpResponse)
  }
})

dataTask.resume()
```
