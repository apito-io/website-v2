Apollo Android requires your GraphQL server's schema as a `schema.json` file. You can obtain the contents of this file by running an introspection query on your server.

The Apollo Gradle plugin exposes a `downloadApolloSchema` task to help you obtain your schema. Provide this task your server's GraphQL endpoint and the output location for the `schema.json` file:

<ApiSecretNote />

```bash title="shell"
./gradlew downloadApolloSchema \
  --endpoint="https://api.apito.com/secured/graphql" \
  --schema="app/src/main/graphql/com/example" \
  --header="Authorization: Bearer API_SECRET"
```
