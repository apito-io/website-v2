import ApiSecretNote from "./shared/api-secret-note.mdx"

This is a GraphQL client for Python 3.6+. Plays nicely with `graphene`, `graphql-core`, `graphql-js` and any other GraphQL implementation compatible with the spec.

## Installation

> **WARNING**: Please note that the following documentation describes the current version which is currently only available as a pre-release and needs to be installed with

    $ pip install --pre gql[all]

> **NOTE**: See also [the documentation](https://gql.readthedocs.io/en/latest/intro.html#less-dependencies) to install GQL with less extra dependencies

### Basic usage

```python
from gql import gql, Client
from gql.transport.aiohttp import AIOHTTPTransport

# Select your transport with a defined url endpoint
transport = AIOHTTPTransport(url="https://api.apito.io/secured/graphql", headers={'Authorization': 'Bearer API_SECRET'})

# Create a GraphQL client using the defined transport
client = Client(transport=transport, fetch_schema_from_transport=True)

# Provide a GraphQL query
query = gql(
    """
    query getContinents {
      continents {
        code
        name
      }
    }
"""
)

# Execute the query on the transport
result = client.execute(query)
print(result)
```
