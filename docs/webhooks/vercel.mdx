To create a Deploy Hook for your project, make sure your project is connected to a Git repository.
Once your project is connected, navigate to its `Settings` page and then select the Git menu item.

First go to your project `Settings` > `Git`

Go to the `Deploy Hooks` section and choose a name for your Deploy Hook and select the branch
that will be deployed when the generated URL is requested.

After submitting the form, you will see a URL that you can copy and use. A Deploy Hook trigger url looks like this,

```
    https://api.vercel.com/v1/integrations/deploy/<token>
```

You have to replace:

   * `<token>` with your deploy trigger token.


:::note

Deploy Hooks will not be triggered if you have the `github.enabled = false` configuration present in a `vercel.json` file.

## Add the Webhook in Apito

Finally, add a webhook in the Apito Console using the url that you have build. To create a webhook you have to go to `Settings` in Apito Console then `Webhooks` from the left
navigation bar and click `Create a Webhook`

You  have to fill in:

  * `Name` Name of the webhooks
  * `Model` The model that the webhook will reflect to
  * `Operation` Choose from which action you would like to trigger the webhook for
  * `Webhook URL` The Gitlab Pipeline Trigger URL

Click on the `CREATE HOOK` to create your trigger hook. Now each time your model updates, in this example `page` updates it will send a `POST` trigger to the URL with the `page` data
in the request body as json.
