Apito has build in webhook support that you can configure to trigger based on actions of your data models.
For example if you want to update your website each time data in a model updates or creates. Now you can.

## Prerequisite

  * Models

If you are looking a way to integrate third party application, webhook could call your send your data based on operation
to a third party URL. You can use this to auto deploy website.

### Creating a Webhook

navigation bar and click `Create a Webhook`

You  have to fill in:

  * `Name` Name of the webhooks
  * `Model` The model that the webhook will reflect to
  * `Operation` Choose from which action you would like to trigger the webhook for
  * `Webhook URL` The Gitlab Pipeline Trigger URL

Click on the `CREATE HOOK` to create your trigger hook. Now each time your model updates, in this example `page` updates it will send a `POST` trigger to the URL with the `page` data
in the request body as json.
