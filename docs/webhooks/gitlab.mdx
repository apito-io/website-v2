If you are using Gitlab for your website or project repository, and you have your pipeline setup via `.gitlab-ci.yml` then you can use our webhook
to auto trigger gitlab ci pipeline.

First go to your project `Settings` > `CI/CD` and click on `Pipeline triggers` and create a trigger.

A Gitlab Pipeline trigger url looks like this,

```
    https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/<project_id>/trigger/pipeline?token=<token>&ref=<ref_name>
```

You have to replace:

   * `<token>` with your trigger token.
   * `<ref_name>` with a branch or tag name, like `main` or `master`.
   * `<project_id>` with your project ID, like `123456`. The project ID is displayed at the top of every projectâ€™s landing page.


## Add the Webhook in Apito

Finally, add a webhook in the Apito Console using the url that you have build. To create a webhook you have to go to `Settings` in Apito Console then `Webhooks` from the left
navigation bar and click `Create a Webhook`

You  have to fill in:

  * `Name` Name of the webhooks
  * `Model` The model that the webhook will reflect to
  * `Operation` Choose from which action you would like to trigger the webhook for
  * `Webhook URL` The Gitlab Pipeline Trigger URL

Click on the `CREATE HOOK` to create your trigger hook. Now each time your model updates, in this example `page` updates it will send a `POST` trigger to the URL with the `page` data
in the request body as json.
