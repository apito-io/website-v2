The first step after creating your project is to define your project models. The most important part of designing an API is Database Modeling.
Let’s start by creating our first model. We all know Products and categories are a crucial part of an ecommerce API.

## 2. Write Apito Function

Click on the Models Tab in the top navigation menu. Then from the left side bar, click on Add a model button. Now, write down the name of the model, in our case it will be product.
Now click on the create button.

## 3. Connect Apito Function

Click on the Contents tab and select your model. As you can see, Table and forms are auto generated based on your database model design.
Let me insert few products and categories into our database. To add a new product, click on the Add a new product button, which is on the right side of the product content table.
You will be able to see a drawer pops up from the right side of our table, which contains an auto generated specialized input form based on your model design.

Let’s add our first product using this form into our database. Let’s add our first category into our database.
As you can see while creating a category you can directly tag products with it. As you can see that product and category are now linked with each other.

## 4. Call your Custom Function

Our Ecommerce API is ready. To explore our API lets goto the `API Explorer` from the top of the navigation menu. As you can see, our GraphQL & REST API is ready for use.
Let’s run our first query. We will now `Search a product that contains blue in its name`. Now click Run and as you can see its working! our ecommerce API is ready for integration.

You can also use REST API if you project requires it. Apito Generates a Swagger Documentation which is compatible with OpenAPI.
