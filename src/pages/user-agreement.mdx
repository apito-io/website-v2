and any third party who gains access to the Apito Console or Services through You or Your Authorized Users, directly or indirectly, whether such access or use
is permitted by or in violation of this Agreement. Each Apito Developer shall use reasonable efforts to make all End Users aware of this Agreement’s provisions
as applicable to each Apito Solution, and shall cause End Users to comply with such provisions.  Apito Developers understand and acknowledge that they are
responsible and liable for obtaining a license agreement from each End User for such End User’s Data (in compliance with all applicable laws) prior to processing
or storing such End User Data through or in connection with an Apito Solution.

**b) License of Developer Solution.**

Each Apito Developer will grant, and hereby does grant,  Apito an unlimited, royalty-free, fully-paid-up, irrevocable, perpetual, non-exclusive,
transferrable (as permitted under the Apito Privacy Policy) worldwide right and license for each Apito Solution and all End User Data collected or
processed through that Apito Solution, but only to the extent necessary for Apito to provide the Services.  Each Apito Developer understands and acknowledges
that it is responsible and liable for obtaining all authorizations necessary for the End User Data it obtains, processes, or stores, and for complying with all
laws and regulations relating to such obtainment, processing, and storage.

any unauthorized access, dissemination, or use of any End-User Data or User Confidential Information or Developer IP, or any inability to use, loss, interruption, delay,
or recovery of any data resulting from a breach of data or system security. Each Apito Developer understands and acknowledges that it is responsible and liable for securing
all End User Data collected through its Apito Solution, and for notifying Apito and all affected End Users of any breach of data or system security of End User’s Data.
Apito will use commercially reasonable efforts to protect Developer IP and End User’s data entered into or stored in Apito’s Environment, provided, however,
that (to the extent permitted by law) Apito shall not be liable to any User or third party for any breach notification or beyond the liability limits set forth in
this Agreement, and then only to the extent such breach is the result of Apito’s recklessness or affirmative wrongdoing.

Apito may from time to time make Third-Party Products available to Users. For purposes of this Agreement, such Third-Party Products are subject
to their own terms and conditions. If a User does not agree to abide by the applicable terms for any such Third-Party Products, then the User may
not install or use such Third-Party Products. You acknowledge and agree that regardless of the manner in which such Third Party Products may
be offered to you (bundled or integrated within certain Services, offered separately by Apito or persons certified or authorized by Apito, or otherwise
offered anywhere on the Apito Console), Apito merely acts as an intermediary platform between you and such Third Party Products, and does not in any way
endorse any such Third Party Products, or shall be in any way responsible or liable with respect thereto. Apito will not be a party to,
or in any way be responsible for monitoring, any interaction or transaction between you and any Third-Party Products. Any and all use of such Third-Party
Products shall be done solely at your own risk and responsibility and may be subject to such legal and financial terms which govern such Third Party Products,
