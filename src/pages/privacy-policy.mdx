# Privacy Policy

**BEFORE SUBMITTING ANY PERSONAL INFORMATION TO APITO PLEASE REVIEW THE FOLLOWING PRIVACY POLICY.
IF YOU DO NOT AGREE WITH ITS TERMS, DO NOT SUBMIT ANY PERSONAL INFORMATION.**


## 1. Who’s who?
“Apito” refers to Apito LLC, a Wyoming Limited Liability Company, When “We” or “Us” or “Our” are used in this policy,
it is a reference to Apito. The “Apito Console” refers to our applications everything inside it including our content,
products and services. “You”or “Your” refers to the person using the Apito Console, or otherwise using the website
accessible through app.apito.io or any other component of the Apito Console. If you are using the Apito Console as
part of your job, or on behalf of your employer, “You”or “Your” refers to both you and your employer.

The Apito Console allows developers to create solutions (“Apito Projects”) that can then be used by third party users.
Each Apito Project is subject to its own privacy policy. This policy addresses only information collected by Apito.
It does not address information collected by Apito Projects, regardless of whether or not you access them through
the Apito Console. Apito does not control how developers who use the Apito Console to create Apito Projects might
collect or use personal information through those Apito Projects.


## 2. What does this Privacy Policy Address?

This Apito Privacy Policy (the “Privacy Policy”), applies to the information that We or Our designees collect via the
Apito Console or by other means when You use the Apito Console directly.  It does not apply to information that is
collected by Apito Projects created using the Apito Console. You should not use any Apito Project until you review
and accept that solution’s individual privacy policy.

This Privacy Policy is a part of the Apito Software as a Service Agreement available at [https://apito.io/user-agreement](/user-agreement) (the “Agreement”).
You accept this Privacy Policy and the Agreement by either creating an account through the Apito Console or otherwise
using or accessing the parts of the Apito Console that are accessible without creating an account.

This Privacy Policy applies to information We ask You to provide to the Apito Console. Any unsolicited information
provided by You (e.g. by sending an email to Us or posting a question in an online chat session before You create an account) is non-confidential and will not be treated as private information. When You provide unsolicited information to Us, You grant Apito a nonexclusive, royalty-free, worldwide, perpetual, irrevocable, transferable, and fully sub-licensable right to use the unsolicited information for any lawful purpose and without limitation or attribution.  We may also remove or redact any information You post in the Apito Console if We determine, in our sole discretion, that such posting is inaccurate, abusive, disrespectful, harassing, derogatory, hateful, or political.

In an effort to alert You further concerning Apito’s privacy practices, We may also collect, use or provide Your
Personal Information as disclosed in short “Privacy Notices” posted on the Apito Console from time to time,
or otherwise provided to You in connection with Your use of the Apito Console. Such Privacy Notices are in
addition to, and not in lieu of this Privacy Policy. To the extent they are different from this Privacy Policy,
they will apply only to the specific Personal Information expressly discussed in the Privacy Notice. This Privacy
Policy is intended to be construed together with any such Privacy Notice.

## 3. What Information We Gather

**(a)** Personal Information. “Personal Information” means individually identifiable information about an individual
collected from that individual by Apito via the Apito Console or by other means (for example, by Your
voluntarily submitting Personal Information to Us via the completion of a registration form or in an email You
send to Us). The types of Personal Information that We may request include, without limitation, Your name, age,
employer, job title, mailing address, email address, and telephone number. Where there are links between the
Apito Console and third party sites or social networks, We may collect account information for accounts You use
on those third party sites or social networks. In some instances, We may also collect the geo-location data of
Your mobile or another device, including, without limitation, GPS-based, Wi-Fi-based, or cell-based location
information. Even though We don’t view them as “Personal Information.” We may also collect Your internet
protocol (IP) address, MAC address, or other machine or network identifiers as You access the Apito Console.
Payment card and financial institution information is collected through our third-party vendors or service
providers. We do not store credit card or financial institution information.

We require registration in order for You to use the Apito Console. As part of the registration process, You will
be required to provide Us with Personal Information. Some of the Personal Information that We ask You to provide
is mandatory and some are voluntary. If You do not provide the mandatory information, You may not be able to use
the Apito Console or Your use may be limited to only certain portions. We reserve the right to change which
parts of the Website require registration, and which do not, as We modify and update the Apito Console.

**(b)** Accessing and Updating Your Personal Information. You may update Your Personal Information via the Apito
Console. If You should become aware that Your Personal Information with Apito is not complete and accurate, You
must promptly update Your Personal Information via Your account. It is Your obligation to ensure that Your
Personal Information is kept up to date. We may backup or replicate Personal Information stored through the
Apito Console for disaster recovery or other purposes. Updates to your Personal Information will not necessarily
be reflected in such backups or replicated data when You make those updates. In the event that any Personal
Information is shared with third parties (as permitted in this Privacy Policy), updates will not be reflected in
the data stored by those third parties unless or until they request an update from Apito and Apito provides that
update (once again, where permitted by this Privacy Policy).

**(c)** Online Tracking. We, and certain service providers operating on Our behalf, collect information about Your
Activity on the Apito Console and applications using tracking technologies such as cookies. Such technologies
are widely used in order to make websites work, or work more efficiently, and to help Us better understand how
people use the Apito Console. In addition, We may utilize third-party advertising arrangements that involve the
use of cookies or web bugs, or similar technologies to help ensure that any advertising delivered to You by us
or third parties is relevant to Your interests. Apito and its designees may use these technologies when You
interact with the Apito Console. If You disable these technologies in Your browser, the Apito Console may not
operate correctly and You may not be able to use certain of its features.

**(d)** Adult Audiences Only. The Apito Console is intended to be used only by persons over 13 years of age. We do not
knowingly collect Personal Information or other information from or about children. You agree to notify Us
immediately in writing via Your Apito account by e-mail to support@apito.io, if You become aware that We have
received information from or about any such individuals.

**(e)** Third Party Sites. Some of Our services may be provided through sites that bear the names and trademarks of Our
partners or suppliers, and that are not under Our control. In addition, the Apito Console may contain links or
other devices that take You to other websites that are also not within Our control or pull content from such
websites for display on the Apito Console. Certain of those other websites may provide products or services to
You directly or on Our behalf. We are not responsible for any aspect of other websites, including, without
limitation, the privacy practices, products, services, or content of such websites. This Privacy Policy will not
apply to such other websites. Apito Projects are the same as third party websites in this respect—We do not
control them or the information they collect and are not responsible for their services or security. Rather,
Your activity and the information that You provide at such other websites will be subject to the privacy
policies and other terms and conditions posted at such other websites. You are responsible for reviewing those
privacy policies and other terms and conditions prior to providing any Personal Information to them, regardless
of whether or not You access them in connection with Your use of the Apito Console. In particular, payment
information for products and services You purchase through the Apito Console are provided by our third-party
payment processing service providers. All payment information You provide will be subject to the privacy
policies and terms of use of those third-party providers. If you have any difficulty locating terms or privacy
policies for our payment processing providers, please contact via support@apito.io and we will help you find them.

Apito has implemented industry-standard measures to protect the security of the Personal Information We collect via the Apito Console. The financial partners We use to collect and process payment information are PCI DSS (Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard) certified.

If We determine that Your Personal Information was accessed in an improper manner, We will comply with applicable laws as We understand them and will cooperate with internal investigators or law enforcement (including by possibly disclosing Your Personal Information to such investigators or law enforcement agencies).

Your Personal Information may also be accessed by anyone having the credentials You use to access the Apito Console. Please understand that You are also responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of Your Personal Information to protect it against unauthorized access or use including, without limitation, by ensuring that any credentials that enable access to the Apito Console use strong passwords and are not shared with any third party. To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, Apito disclaims any responsibility or liability for any misuse of Your Personal Information that results from illegal, improper, negligent, malicious, or inappropriate acts or omissions of You or any third party, or from any conduct, other than willful conduct of Apito.

Apito may retain Your Personal Information for as long as You continue to use the Apito Console and for as long thereafter as permitted or required by applicable law or by agreements we have with third parties relating to such data. If We delete Your Personal Information, it may still be contained on backup media or other systems until such times as such media is destroyed or overwritten, or data on such other systems are otherwise deleted.

## 6. Your Rights.
In accordance with the applicable law, Apito will provide You with access to Your Personal Information and, as appropriate, the right to intervene in respect of Your Personal Information. You may also be entitled to request the deletion of Your Personal Information, in which case, if Apito, in its sole discretion, deems deletion of such Personal Information as mandatory or appropriate, Apito may do so; provided, however, that such deletion will mean that You may no longer be permitted to engage in certain activities, and may not have any further access to records of Your use of the Apito Console. Deletion of Personal Information in this way may also result in your forfeiture of any usage credits or promotional credits earned by You prior to the deletion.

For the purpose of exercising Your rights, You must submit a request to Us in accordance with the applicable law via Your Apito account, or by email at support@apito.io. In addition, if You believe that Apito has not complied with this Privacy Policy with respect to Your Personal Information, please submit a sufficiently detailed complaint to Us in any of the foregoing manners. We will promptly investigate Your complaint. Thereafter, We will take those measures that We deem necessary to remedy the issues outlined in Your complaint that We, in Our sole discretion, view as justified. If Apito deletes Personal Information, de-identified summaries, backup copies, and legal records may continue to contain portions of the Personal Information thereafter.

## 7. Your Choices.
You can decide if You want to provide Your Personal Information to Apito. If You do not understand and agree to this Privacy Policy DO NOT provide Personal Information to Us. Please note, however, that if You do not provide certain Personal Information, You may not be able to use the Apito Console, or access certain features of the Apito Console.

If You choose (through the Apito Console) to receive communications regarding special offers, or any other information, We may add Your Personal Information to Our email database and use (or direct Our designees to use) Your Personal Information for providing such communications to You. You may later choose to unsubscribe from receiving such communications by following the unsubscribe directions in Our communications. If You provide Apito with inconsistent privacy preferences (for example, by indicating on one occasion that We may provide You with marketing offers and on another occasion that We may not), Apito will endeavor to update Your privacy preferences in Apito’s records with Your latest preference in a timely manner, but We cannot guarantee how quickly such changes will take effect. Apito is not responsible for notifying third parties who may have received Your personal information from us (as permitted by this policy) of any updates You make to Your preferences but may do so as part of any updates or refreshes provided to those third parties.
